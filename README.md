How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?


    The best way to write readable and maintainable code is try to write the least amount of code and reuse code. It is also very important to put notations in code not only for your benfit but for those who may need to update or fix a problem in code.





    
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

    
    
    For this project of making the dashboard  found it difficult to figure out the problem because of error messages. In other ide's it normanlly give you a error code, line, or message to help you pin point the problem. I approch a problem by taking one task at a time, I do not move forward until the first problem is solved and been tested. 





What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Ths project would help gratly n narrowing down search results. Without the dashboard the company would have to go through thousands of records. I believe the job of a computer scientists to to find ways to make computers Functionality easier to use. Like how the dashboard made Grazioso Salvare's job easier by creating functions to simplify the job.
